When I was an undergraduate in Wuhan around 2018, my internet tutor taught me how to create and beautify a web page. After many years, I still keep the habit of updating my personal webpage and saving old server documents. GitHub is an excellent platform. I hope the Internet can trace my growth month by month.   --22/11/23  

**CV**: I was born in a beatiful place of Fujian Provice. In 2016, I left my hometown and went north to Hubei, where I was a freshman majoring in physics at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. At that time, physics students all fancied relative theory and quantum mechanics. Those who did not perform well in the grades will turn to find a job related to circuit design or hardware. The first time I saw a wafer was at the National University of Singapore, during the summer school and the visit to the Nano laboratory. But we are mostly attracted by the industrialization of growing graphene on the silicon wafer, when the graphene is almost the symbol of "science" in those years. 

Later, I went to Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, which belongs to the Chinese Academic of Science, as a Microelectronics postgraduate student. I spent my first year at University of Science and Technology of China. And then went back to SIMIT institute to finish the rest study focus on topic about THz near-field microscopy. It was a span of tough days and nights, where I had to do long time multi-physics simulation, do experiments and analyze results by myself. Luckily, I also learned a lot from knowledge to adaptation. 

Now, I am a TD/PIE of a DRAM company in Hefei. Only after graduating from school have I understood the difference between academic and industrialization, which is like the difference between epicure and cook. I find it great to keep learning new things and getting different knowledge. Ancestors bring opening and sharing, which will be the mainstream in this wonderful world!

后续还想更新一些命令行笔记和工艺的笔记。但是可能要稍晚一些，已经两个月没有办法动了。

# 也欢迎大家加我Github账号，我以前注册了，但是现在才在用的

# 然后，帮我提提意见，怎么设计网页

先这样，Markdown还是非常好用的，随时有空就来打打字~
After being trapped in my dormitory for weeks, I decided to retake my numerical computing work. So, I will keep on uploading my reading to this website. You can keep on tracing me, and I am sincerely waiting for your advice.
You can also visit [my_ustc_webpage](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~clwu/) for more information.
